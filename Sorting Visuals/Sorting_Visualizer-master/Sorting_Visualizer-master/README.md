# Sorting Visualizer


A web-based application that visualizes various sorting algorithms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work by visually representing their process in real time.


## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and more.
- Adjustable speed to control the animation speed of sorting.
- Interactive interface to allow users to see step-by-step sorting processes.
- Mobile-friendly and responsive design for a better user experience.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git


```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd sorting-visualizer



```
Open index.html in your preferred browser.

Alternatively, you can host it on any static file hosting service like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
## Algorithms Implemented
- Bubble Sort: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- Quick Sort: Divides the array into smaller partitions and sorts them individually.

- Merge Sort: Divides the array into two halves and merges them back in sorted order.
- Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
- Heap Sort: Uses a binary heap data structure to efficiently sort the array. It first builds a max heap from the array, and then repeatedly swaps the root of the heap with the last element and reduces the heap size until the array is sorted.
